Add `swipeBack: 'custom' | 'browser' | 'disabled'` with live mode switching and browser mode as the new default. Existing consumers should set `swipeBack: 'custom'` to keep custom swiping; gesture tuning alone no longer enables it. Custom and disabled modes request document-wide browser swipe suppression where supported, without blocking Back/Forward buttons. Release shared suppression on mode changes and destruction, cancel active drags safely, and keep native touch handling when custom swiping is off.
